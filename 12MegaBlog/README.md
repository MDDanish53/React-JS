## This Blog Website project describes the basic functionality of almost every social media platform as follows :

1. This website provides user authentication through login and register features.
2. This website provides the user to create a new post by providing the title, description, image and the status of the post.
3. The user can update the created post in the future.
4. I'd used Appwrite for backend as a service in order to store the user authentication information, post content as well as the images of the post.
5. The user can only see the posts if he is logged in properly.
6. I'd used the Real time text editor using timymce-react to write the post content.
7. This website shows the actual working of the CRUD operations and how they are used in social media platforms
8. I'd used react router for page navigation
9. I'd used AuthLayout component in order to navigate the user to the home page if logged in and if not then redirect him to the login page and prevent the access
